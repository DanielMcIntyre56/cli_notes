## A list of features I want to implement in the future

- [ ] Show only todays notes by default but archive all notes so they can be viewed later on demand.
    - [ ] Add a datetime property to each note and store it in the database
    - [ ] By default list only notes from today.
    - [ ] Update the `.txt` file Rainmeter displays with only todays notes.
    - [ ] Add a new option to the CLI part of the tool to list notes from previous days or time ranges.

- [ ] Add an option to the CLI part of the tool to mark a note as completed by its `note_id`. This could strikethrough the note, add a check mark next to it, or something along these lines.
